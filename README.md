# RealEstateSystem
A simple console-based Real Estate Management System built with Java. This project allows vendors to manage apartment listings by adding, updating, and deleting apartments, while buyers can view available apartments for sale or rent & leave feedback for each apartment. The system supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and features role-based functionality.
